Place your analysis code in this file; you must not rename it, though you may delete these instructions.

You can see whether the automatic rendering worked in the "Actions" tab of the github repository.

If you use any libraries other than `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `sf`, `ggplot2`, `here`, and `terra`, add them to the list in the DESCRIPTION file.
